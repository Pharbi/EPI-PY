## Elements of Programming Interviews: Python

_Disclaimer:_ This should now be thought of as a guide of sorts of a way to actually interview prep.

Currently iterating through most chapters of EPI to catch up on what I've generally missed.
Going to create files for individual chapters and one main file to run them when necessary, in an attempt to get clean
code through.

Chapters 1..3 are general overtures to where to start, so those are skipped.

Looking to have a bit of fun, so I'll be skipping around problems as I go. First I'll start with the essentials, then
I'll circle back to the essentials but in a time constrained manner.
